- **Customer demographics** (Age, Gender, Location)  
- **Purchase details** (Product Category, Amount Spent)  
- **Retail analysis** (Sales Volume, Discounts, Payment Methods)  

## Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python** for data manipulation  
- **Pandas** for data cleaning and transformation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization  

## Key Insights  
- **High-spending age groups** identified to target marketing efforts  
- **Popular product categories** that drive revenue
